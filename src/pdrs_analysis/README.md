# Functionality

1. Given PDRs input lists like ScalarDissipationRates = [1, 2, 5], Pressures = [1.0e5, 2.0e5], ..., it will run a Cartesian product of all possible PDRs Runs
1. Then, it can analyze the results when two PDRs inputs are varied (i.e., 2D) through a heat map. It is set up to be extended nicely to graph 0D, 1D, etc.
